  <p>ZeroMQ will prefix each logline with a String. How this prefix will look like can be determined here.<br/>
  It is basically a groovyscript and whatever it evaluates to will be used as prefix.
  Example:<br/>
  jenkins.getRootUrl() + "/job/" + build.getProject().getName()+"/"+build.getNumber()+" "<br/>
  would return something like:<br/>
  http://localhost:8080/jenkins/job/test/42
